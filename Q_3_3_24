According to the textbook, for the worst case in red-black BSTs is 
"The worst case is a 2-3 tree that is all 2-nodes except that the leftmost
path is made up of 3-nodes. The path taking left links from the root is twice as long
as the paths of length ~ lg N that involve just 2-nodes. It is possible, but not easy, to
develop key sequences that cause the construction of red-black BSTs whose average
path length is the worst-case 2 lg N."
